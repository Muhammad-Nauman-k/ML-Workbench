# PyTorch Classifier from Scratch

This project implements a simple **feedforward neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** using **PyTorch** to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset (or any dataset in CSV format).  
It demonstrates how to build a neural network **from scratch** without relying on high-level training abstractions.

## üöÄ Features
- Custom **Dataset & DataLoader** implementation  
- Fully connected neural network (MLP) with ReLU activations  
- Training loop with **SGD optimizer** and **CrossEntropyLoss**  
- Data preprocessing (normalization, train-test split)  
- Easily extendable for other classification tasks
